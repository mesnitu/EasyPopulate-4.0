REQUIREMENTS:

Zencart 1.38/1.39 or 1.5.x except 1.5.2
PHP 4.3.2 or above.

PRIOR TO INSTALLATION:

It is highly recommended that you install Dr. Bytes "Backup MYSQL Plugin" before installing 
and using EasyPopulate 4.0 Beta (EP4). It has been updated to work with Zencart 1.5 
and can be downloaded from here:

http://www.zen-cart.com/index.php?main_page=product_contrib_info&products_id=81

Also note that EasyPopulate 4.0 Beta will install and run independently of all other 
versions of easypopulate. Names 1.2.5.4 (and flavors) and EP Advance 3.0.3.

INSTALLATION (Upgrade from any prior version of EP4) is suggested as follows:

1) From the configuration->Easy Populate menu, document all of the settings so that they may be re-entered after installation.
2) From the tools->Easy Populate 4 menu, uninstall EP4 through the link in the upper right corner.
3) Load the files from the attached zip file into their standard location as is done through the below EP4 installation instruction.
4) Refresh the Tools->EP4 window.
5) Select the install option in the middle of the Tools->EP4 window.
6) Return to the configuration->Easy Populate window and re-enter the settings captured in step 1.  Also review the new options made available to support use of the rewriter.  


INSTALLATION:

1. Change the name of the "admin" directory to match your Zencart installation. 

2. Upload all files in the "admin" directory to your site maintaining directory structure.
   No core files are changed.

	a) If you are using zencart 1.3.8/1.3.9, you need to also upload the additional
        files in the "zencart 1.3 extra files" folder. 

	b)  If you are using zencart 1.5.x, no additional files need to be uploaded as the file necessary
	 to support ZenCart 1.5.x has been placed within the above "admin" directory. 

3. Login to your store's admin. Under Tools you will see a new entry "Easy Populate 4". 
   (If you do not see this entry, you did not upload your files correctly.)

4. Click on Tools -> Easy Populate 4. You will have 1 (possibly 2) warnings at the top of the page:

   Warning Easy Populate "Uploads Folder" missing!
   Your uploads folder is missing. Your configuration indicates that your uploads folder is named EASYPOPULATE_4_CONFIG_TEMP_DIR/, and is located in .../public_html/.
   Warning Easy Populate Configuration Missing. Please install your configuration by clicking here

   Click the "here" link to install EP4's configuration files.

5. Now go to Configuration -> Easy Populate 4 and edit the Uploads Directory. The default directory is "temp/"
   This assumes you have a directory "temp" in the admin of your website. I highly recommend that you
   keep your temp directory in your admin, or change the name to something that is obscure for security reasons.

   Note: If you are using Zencart 1.5 and want to move your Uploads directory into this folder, you will need to 
   customize the/an .htaccess file to add allowed file types of .csv/.CSV and .txt/.TXT.  Otherwise when attempting to
   download these files you may be presented with a denial to access the file(s).

6. Now click on Tools -> Easy Populate 4. The warning messages should be gone. Note that your temp/
   directory will need correct permissions. EP4 will give you a warning if it cannot write to the temp/ directory
   that you set. Common permissions are "777" or "755". Contact your hosting provider if you are having problems
   setting permissions to writable, but you can usually do this through your site's CPANEL, or via a FTP program.

UN-INSTALLATION:

To un-install EP4, go to Tools -> Easy Populate 4 and click the Un-Install EP4 link on the right-hand side of your screen.
This will remove the Configuration keys for EP4. You will then need to delete EP4's files from your server. 


POST INSTALLATION NOTES:

EP4 will display the current version and Beta date. This will help you keep track of your version and updates as they are posted to github.

On the right-hand side of your screen you will see some additional information:

	- An un-install link that will remove EP4's configuration keys.
	- Your currently set Temporary Directory
	- Supported Mods
	- Installed Languages

Supported Mods: These are where you'll find additional fields that have been added to the products table by a separate application
and are recognized by EP4 for use.
Note that Product Unit of Measure (UOM) and Product UPC Code are two custom mods of Chadd.

Github will continue to be updated with improvements as they come. Once EP4 has passed "beta" it will be submitted 
to the Zencart team for consideration. Your feedback and testing is greatly appreciated!

Thank you,
Chadd and mc12345678
